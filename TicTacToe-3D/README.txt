You have to download all the files and have Java oracle or use an IDE with java.awts jar installed.

The game is 4x4x4 Tic Tac Toe like on the old atari systems. I even based the design off of those systems.
You run the program by running boardDisplay.java. You are X's and the AI is O's and you go first. You pick where you wanna
go by clicking that space with the mouse. Its 3D so any straight line through the cube will win the game. You can change the 
AI's difficulty level by changing the variable char difficulty in the boardDisplay (Interface to do that in the game soon to 
come). It's on hard mode now but if you change the char to 'e' or 'm' it'll become easy or medium respectively. If you have 
time and wnat more of a challenge you can change the difficulty to 'x' which is extreme and I haven't even beaten it yet.

Good Luck Have Fun!
